Prerequisites
-------------

You will need the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.4) with a Reals theory compiled in.
You will also need the Flocq library (>= 2.5, < 3.0, http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/)
to be installed. In order to use the "gappa" tactic, Gappa needs to be installed.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the git repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
git, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

    ./configure && ./remake -j2 && ./remake install

The COQC environment variable can be passed to the configure script in order
to set the Coq compiler command. The configure script defaults to "coqc".
Similarly, COQDEP can be used to specify the location of "coqdep". The
COQBIN environment variable can be used to set both variables at once.

The same OCaml compiler used for compiling Coq should be used for
compiling the tactic. It is found by calling "$COQC -config". The OCAMLC
environment variable can be used to override this choice. Variable CAMLP4
plays a similar role for the OCaml preprocessor.

Option "--libdir=DIR" sets the directory where the compiled library files
should be installed by "./remake install". By default, the target directory
is "`$COQC -where`/user-contrib/Gappa".

The files are compiled at a logical location starting with "Gappa".
